# Doc4TF

## What is Doc4TF

Doc4TF is a Jupyter Notebook containing Python code designed to automatically generate a documentation set for any Text-Fabric dataset based on its actual data. It serves as a robust starting point for developing new documentation, a substitute for missing documentation, or a tool for validating existing documentation.

For more information see [this page](about.md).

## How to use Doc4TF

Since Doc4TF is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook, you will need an environment capable of running Jupyter Notebooks. Given that this tool is intended for use alongside Text-Fabric, often used in a Jupyter Notebook, it's likely that you already have such an environment set up.
