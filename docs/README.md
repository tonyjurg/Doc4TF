# Doc4TF

## What is Doc4TF

Doc4TF is a Jupyter Notebook containing Python code to automatically generate a documentation set for any Text-Fabric dataset based upon its actual data. It can be serve as substitute for lacking documentation, as a robust starting point for developing a brand new documentation set or as validation for an existing one.

For more information see [this page](about.md).

## How to use Doc4TF

Since Doc4TF is implemented as a Jupyter notebook, you will need an environment capable of running Jupyter notebooks. As this tool is intended to be used alongside Text-Fabric, it's likely that you have already set up such an environment.
